# Wrangle and Analyze Data: WeRateDogs

## Introduction

Real world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

## Project Details:

Data wrangling, which consists of:
1. Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
2. Assessing data
3. Cleaning data

Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data

Reporting on:
1) your data wrangling efforts and 
2) your data analyses and visualizations
