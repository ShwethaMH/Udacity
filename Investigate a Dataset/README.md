## Projec Overview
As part of this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate the results. Analysis is carried out using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Installation
During installation, I selected Anaconda, which provided all the needed packages, including the following libraries:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. csv

## Choosing the Dataset 
For this project I have selected TMDB movie dataset for analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDB), including user ratings and revenue.

## Getting Organized
A single folder is created which contains the following:
1. Report communicating the findings
2. Python code written as part of the analysis 
3. The dataset used.

## Analyze the Data
Based on the dataset chosen, I formulated a few questions that would be answered through analysis.

## Submission
My submission included the following:
1. A PDF file containing my analysis.
2. Code (Jupyter Notebook) used for the analysis
3. References made
